**C. How to connect your Niagahoster with Cloudfire**

1. Make sure you already buy external domain. In this example, I already bought domain from niagahoster. Please ensure it is already active.

2. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/ and log in or create new account. You will be redirected to dashboard. You can add the domain that you have in Niagahoster. 

3. Go to dashboard Cloudflare then select DNS Record and Name Server. Copy these nameservers and jump into Niagahoster. You should replace it with Nameservers from CloudFlare.

5. All process are done. You should wait within 1x24 hours to let the NiagaHoster and Cloudfire setting up the DNS. Once it is activated, you will see this message.
